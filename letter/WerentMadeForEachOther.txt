Dear AngelI am very much looking forward to going out with you. But I can't.Because I didn't know it is Chinese Valentine's Day before you asked me out. But now I know, and begin to feel afraid. I can't deceive you like this anymore, and I also can't deceive myself.Because I never had the thought that we will be lovers, and it’s not relevant to study and other things, it’s about the feeling.You're a good girl, but we weren't made for each other.Sorry.Yours SincerelyTony
