Dear Andrew

    Hi! My name is Tony. I am very glad to have this change to write to and become pen pals.

    Let first introduce myself. I'm a junior student currently studying English in a university located in Beijing. My hobbies include listening to pop music and wathcing movies.

    This summer, I will graduate from my school and stepfoward to contribute to my country, which I find very pround of and can't wait to make my own effort. But before my graduation, I will be travelling to ShangHai, If you're free I would be joyful to meet you. Well, let finish here. I am already eagerly awaiting your reply. I hope that we can become good firends.

Yours corially,
Tony
