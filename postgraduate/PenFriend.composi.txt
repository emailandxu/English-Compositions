Dear Lucy
 
I am writing to ask for your opinion about writing letter to each other in purpose of enhancing our English composition ability. 
 
As you know the exam requires an outstanding writing capacity, lets me have to spend a lot of energy to satisfy its requirement.
 
If I could have such an earnest English learner like you to be my pen friend, then it would be much easier for me on the way to pass the exam. And I think It is also helpful for you.
 
So I formally invite you to be my pen friend, would you mind being a pen friend of mine?
 
I would be grateful to receive your reply.
 
Yours sincerely
Tony
