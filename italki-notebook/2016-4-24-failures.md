## Do you consider bad luck as the reason of your failures?
Many people may have struggled for their dream only to eventually fail. They find a reason in bad luck and try to explain their failure just to avoid despair. I think why should we let these poor people be exposed to the pain of failure?
People fail but they want live better so let them consider in that way.

(for your easier reading I have just written a little. Please help me find some mistake in it ^^ )
Very well written!
