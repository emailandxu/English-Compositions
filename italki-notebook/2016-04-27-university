#What can we gain from university?
Many people expect to be a competent guy like a expert after college, so they study a lot read a lot that about their major to approach their goals.
But I want ask that can we be a expert just after four years journey in universities? For Someone it maybe, but for most of ordinal people it is a impossible mission.So what our tutor taught us and what the university taught us is how to be a expert easier.
