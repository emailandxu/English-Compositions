#What can we gain from university?
Many people expect to be a competent guy like a expert after college, so they study a lot read a lot about their major to approach their goals. 
But I want to ask what can we expert just after a four year journey in a university? For Someone it maybe, but for most ordinal people it is an impossible mission. So what our tutor taught us and what the university taught us is how to be a expert easier?
